# twbkspoof
a twbk survey pen-testing tool
##Usage
just run node ./main.js
settings are currently just variables in main.js
##Things you have to set:
id -> set this to xyz.twbk.de/id <--- this
the rest can just be left as is

#Issues:
currently, replay Attack does not work, just use the reAuth (Server slows down after ca. 50 requests ?? <- this is no program issue tho)
